  <h1>About</h1>
  <div class="section">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In this data set, we looked into the top 10 causes of deaths from the years of 1999 through 2017. Each cause of death is individually listed by state. Also provided is the year total per cause of death, and the age-adjusted death rate. The age-adjusted death rate is calculated using the 2010 census. For years prior to that, intercensal population estimates are used. We aquired this datasource from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-leading-causes-of-death-united-states</p>

  <div class="section">
      <h2>Nominal Death Count</h2>
      <p>Nominal death count refers to the actual number of deaths that have occurred in a given period, without any adjustments for age, sex, or other factors. It is a raw count of the number of people who have died due to any cause. Nominal death count is an important metric for understanding the overall health of a population and for tracking trends in mortality over time.</p>
      <p>This provides a basic and straightforward way to understand the overall mortality or death in a population. However, it does not take into account variations in age distribution or other factors that might affect the death count. Demographers often use age-specific death rates or other more refined measures to analyze mortality patterns in more detail.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
      <h2>Age Adjusted Death Rate</h2>
      <p>The age-adjusted death rate is a measure of mortality that controls for the effects of differences in population age distributions. It is a statistical method used to compare mortality rates between populations with different age structures. Age-adjusted death rates are calculated by applying age-specific death rates to a standard population, which allows for the comparison of mortality rates between populations with different age distributions.</p>
      <p>The age-adjusted death rate is expressed as the number of deaths per 100,000 people in the standard population. This method is used to account for the fact that different populations have different age distributions, and therefore different mortality rates. The standard population is usually chosen to be representative of the population being studied, and is used as a reference to calculate expected death rates for each age group.</p>

      <h2>CODâ€™s (Causes of Death)</h2>
      <p>CLRD (Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease) - is a term used to describe a group of respiratory diseases that affect the lungs and airways. The four most common chronic diseases that fall under the umbrella of CLRD are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. Cigarette smoking is the major cause of these illnesses, accounting for about 80% of cases.</p>
